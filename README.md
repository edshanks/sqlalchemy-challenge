"app.py" is the script responsible for running the API and "climate_starter" is the script for generating queries and plots in Jupyter Notebook. Both scripts are located in the "SurfsUp" folder. All of the raw data is located in the csv and sqlite files located in the "Resources" folder.

To run the API, open "app.py" in a Conda Powershell and copy and paste the resulting link into a browser. Once open in a browser, the homepage will list all of the available routes and describe the data found in each route. Additionally, there are some example links to illustrate the date format needed to query data. The script is written such that the user can see in an Anaconda Powershell which route is being accessed at any given moment in the API. 

If you encounter any issues with the API and/or the "app.py" script, try to run the script in the Python3 virtual environment. I had difficulty opening "app.py" in the PythonData virtual environment.
